# Simple-python-chatbot-v.0
T# Chatbot v.0

## Description
This is a simple chatbot program written in Python. It is designed to interact with users by asking for their name, age, and favorite color, and then responding based on their input. This project is part of my learning journey in Python, and it demonstrates the use of basic concepts like input/output, data types (strings and integers), and simple logic.

## Features
- Asks the user for their name and greets them.
- Asks the user for their age and responds with a message based on their age.
- Asks the user for their favorite color and comments on it.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to build the chatbot.
- **Basic Python Concepts**:
  - Input/Output (`input()` and `print()`)
  - Data Types (`string` and `int`)
  - Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)

## How to Run the Project
